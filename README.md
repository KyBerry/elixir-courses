# elixir-courses

This is a combination of courses that I am taking to learn Elixir. I will be taking extensive notes and adding it to this README doc for anyone who wants to learn and or just go over my notes. Thx ;)

## Numbers

There are two types of numbers in Elixir _**Integers**_ and _**Floats**_.
`2 / 1 = 2.0` Dividing returns a Float.
`100000000` No matter how long our number gets it will be considered an Integer.
`1_000_000_000` for readability you can add _**underscores**_ in place of a comma.
The only limit on Integers in Elixir is the amount of available memory in the system.
